# About
For my master's thesis, I decided to use Python for all my plotting. This repository contains two files: *plot.py* and *snippets.txt*:

### *plot.py*
Contains all read-functions and basic plot-functions for data collected from different techniques. It essentially functions as a library, but is used in much more primitively.
The *main*-section of the program is where the action happens. Here code-snippets from *snippets.txt* is pasted, and run. This is not how you generally plot or evaluate data, but it works fantastically for my purpose.

### *snippets.txt*
Contains, not surprisingly, the code-snippets used for my induvidual plots and evaluations in separated sections. Some snippets were used for multiple figures, and here the parts that are different for each figure are separated in a subsection for each snippet.
